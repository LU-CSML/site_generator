### Welcome

Lancaster University Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (LU-CSML) is a reading group of academics and students at Lancaster University.

We usually meet weekly at 3pm Thursday and alternate between discussing each other's research and [recent papers](https://lu-csml.github.io/papers/). The group host [talks](https://lu-csml.github.io/talks/) that have been given by both our members and external guests.

The interests of the group are around, but not limited to:

* Bayesian methods
* Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
* Sequential Monte Carlo
* Scalable Monte Carlo
* Changepoint analysis
* Gaussian processes
* Diffusion processes  

If you would like to be added to the mailing list, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://lu-csml.github.io/contact).
