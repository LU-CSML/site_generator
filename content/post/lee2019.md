Stochastic block model (SBM) is a popular choice for clustering nodes in a network. In this talk, a few versions of SBM will be reviewed, with the focus on the clustering approach (hard vs soft), and its relation with the subsequent MCMC algorithm. Model selection and some practical issues will also be discussed.
